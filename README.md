# Week-2-Challange (Portfolio website Prototype)

## Description

```
I built a basic (unfinished) prototype for a website portfolio website for potential future employers to visit, as well as test the my skills at the topics learned so far in class. I have a slid grasp on HTML and learned plenty about CSS, however in terms of CSS, I have a very long way to go and plan to continuously study. I also plan to tweak my site for quite a while until I am satisfied with it. Although as a starting point I feel I've done a decent job. I made sure to follow the Acceptance Criteria, and tried my best to follow it.
